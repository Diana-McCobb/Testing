System is for ordering drinks from the coffee shop.

Unit test example
When the "latte" object is input to the "get-drink" function, then expect the price for each size to be returned in an array.

Integration test example
When we run the get method to get the drink object for a drink, but the drink is not found, then expect the response to be 404 (not found).

System test example
When we select "coffee" as a type of drink, then expect the range of coffees with the price for each cup size to be displayed on the front end.

User acceptance test example
As a thirsty caffiene deprived customer
I want to view the coffee menu
So that I can select my morning coffee

Given the user has navigated to the home page
When the "coffee menu" button is selected
Then only the range of coffees is displayed in a table that has the coffee name, price for small cup, price for medium cup and price for large cup and a selection button.

Further refinement - only coffees are displayed (i.e. no other products), and all coffees are display (i.e. all products categorised as coffee on the database).
