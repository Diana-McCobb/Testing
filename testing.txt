System is for ordering drinks from the coffee shop.

Unit test example
When the "latte" object is input to the "get-drink" function, then expect the price for each size to be returned in an array.

Integration test example
When we run the get method to get the drink object for a drink, but the drink is not found, then expect the response to be 404 (not found).

System test example
When we select "coffee" as a type of drink, then expect the range of coffees with the price for each cup size to be displayed on the front end.
